# Governance Staker

ðŸš§ A complete README is Coming Soonâ„¢.

## Development

These contracts were built and tested with care by the team at [ScopeLift](https://scopelift.co).

### Build and test

This project uses [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) to install it.

Clone the repo.

Set up your .env file

```bash
cp .env.template .env
# edit the .env to fill in values
```

Install dependencies & run tests.

```bash
forge install
forge build
forge test
```

### Spec and lint

This project uses [scopelint](https://github.com/ScopeLift/scopelint) for linting and spec generation. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ScopeLift/scopelint?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to install it.

To use scopelint's linting functionality, run:

```bash
scopelint check # check formatting
scopelint fmt # apply formatting changes
```

To use scopelint's spec generation functionality, run:

```bash
scopelint spec
```

This command will use the names of the contract's unit tests to generate a human readable spec. It will list each contract, its constituent functions, and the human readable description of functionality each unit test aims to assert.
